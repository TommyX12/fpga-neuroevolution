floating point arithmetic with 'real' datatype


standardized datapath access
    start signal to datapath
    finished signal from datapath
    instruction to datapath
        32 bit standardized instruction for doing anything, such as memory read, write, write to screen, etc.
        highest 4 bits: opcode: determines operation to use.
            0: do nothing.
            1: draw to frame buffer.
                bit 0-7: x
                bit 8-14: y
                bit 15-17: color
                bit 18: plot
                
            2: read from memory
                bit 0-15: address
                
            3: write to memory
                bit 0-15: address
                bit 16-27: value
                
            4: output frame buffer
                bit 0-7: x
                bit 8-14: y
                
            5: 
            6: 
            7: 
            8: 
            9: 
            10: 
            11: 
            12: 
            13: 
            14: 
            15: 
    
    return value from datapath
        32 bit value corresponding to each possible operation in the instruction to datapath

datapath multiplexer for concurrent access control.
    generate for arbitrary number of inputs.
    multiplex each of the 4 standard signals for datapath access, for each input.
    scan for an input that has unfinished instruction. pass its instructions to datapath and wait for output, then put that into the corresponding output to that input and set finished for it. repeat.
    
!!! make a frame buffer that act the same as vga adapter but is just a memory. all draw now draw to frame buffer, and final step draw from frame buffer to screen.
