floating point arithmetic with 'real' datatype


standardized datapath access
    start signal to datapath
    finished signal from datapath
    instruction to datapath
        32 bit standardized instruction for doing anything, such as memory read, write, write to screen, etc.
    
    return value from datapath
        32 bit value corresponding to each possible operation in the instruction to datapath

datapath multiplexer for concurrent access control.
    generate for arbitrary number of inputs.
    multiplex each of the 4 standard signals for datapath access, for each input.
    scan for an input that has unfinished instruction. pass its instructions to datapath and wait for output, then put that into the corresponding output to that input and set finished for it. repeat.
